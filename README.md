# Prerelease-Adoption-Commiment-GDMR-Model
R code for PAC estimation using GDMR model

The code is a joint project by Aslan Lotfi and Xinxue (Shawn) Qu. 


Since well-known diffusion models do not consider repeat purchases, Lotfi et al. (2016) has adopted a fractional-calculus-based generalization of the Bass diffusion model to accommodate repeat purchases at the product-line level. This code is the implementation of FCBM, and application of FCBM to fit product pre-release adoption commitment (PAC).
